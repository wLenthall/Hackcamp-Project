Standalone Application for Matching Students and Placements
Business Context: 
    •Commissioned by UK Government -National Centre for Universities and Business (NCUB) study January 2015: Growing Experience, A Review of Undergraduate Placements in Computer Science for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. “The final quarter of 2013 saw the fastest increase in UK technology sector business for over four years, and 44% of UK technology firms were planning to hire more staff in 2014. Despite this, the computer science graduates who are fundamental to this growth show the highest level of unemployment of all students six months after leaving university”. “...time and again research and employers point to undergraduate work placements as an effective method for improving employment outcomes in computing.”.
    •Anecdotal: university lecturers have observed that students who have taken up an industrial placement fare better in their final year academic studies, and more students find employment, when compared with peers who don’t take up an industrial placement.

This project, on behalf of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, Manchester Branch, will implement anapplication that matches students with employers offering year-long placements.

Information should be provided in the application about the benefits of placements to both students and employers. The application might be used by staff in university careers offices, employer talent management departments and installed in university libraries.

Students can provide contact details (name, email, phone number, and postal address) and store a CV (in .PDF file format).Use categories, skillsand levelsterminology from Skills for the Information Age (SFIA) Version 6 to do the matching.

Employers can provide contact details (contact name, email, phone number, and postal address). In addition employers should provide details of each placement opportunity:
    •Placement description,
    •Skills required,
    •Salary offered,
    •Location, and
    •Preferred start and end date.
    
Using an online dating agency analogy, the site should match placements with students. Employers and students should be contacted (by email?) when a potential match occurs.Use Resources
